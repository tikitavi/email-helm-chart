This directory contains a email Helm chart. To use it, use your
favorite text editor to replace <CHARTNAME> with the proposed name of
your chart.

The email-helm-chart chart presupposes that your application requires the
following resources:
* deployment
* service
* configmap
* secret
* persistentvolumeclaim
* ingress

To make use of the chart, add it to the directory helm/charts/chartname.

Feel free to add and remove resources as necessary for your application.
